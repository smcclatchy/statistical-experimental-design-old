> ## Exercise 1: Which kind of error?
> A study used to determine the effect of a drug on weight loss 
> could have the following sources of experimental error. 
> Classify the following sources as either biological, 
> systematic, or random error.  
> 1). A scale is broken and provides inconsistent readings.  
> 2). A scale is calibrated wrongly and consistently measures mice 1 gram heavier.   
> 3). A mouse has an unusually high weight compared to its experimental group (i.e., it is an outlier).  
> 4). Strong atmospheric low pressure and accompanying storms affect instrument readings, animal behavior, and indoor relative humidity.

> ## Discussion
> Why not assign treatment and control groups to samples in alphabetical order?  
> Did we really need a random number generator to obtain randomized equal groups?

> > 1). Scenario: One technician processed samples A through M, and a different 
> > technician processed samples N through Z.  
> > 2). Another scenario: Samples A through M were processed on a Monday, and 
> > samples N through Z on a Tuesday.  
> > 3). Yet another scenario: Samples A through M were from one strain, and 
> > samples N through Z from a different strain.    
> > 4). Yet another scenario: Samples with consecutive ids were all sibling 
> > groups. For example, samples A, B and C were all siblings, and all assigned 
> > to the same treatment.  
> > All of these cases would have introduced an effect (from the technician, the 
> > day of the week, the strain, or sibling relationships) that would confound 
> > the results and lead to misinterpretation.

## Among-subject vs. within-subject variability
Each subject can be its own control
