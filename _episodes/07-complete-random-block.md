## Design issues

> ## Exercise 1: Which kind of error?
> A study used to determine the effect of a drug on weight loss 
> could have the following sources of experimental error. 
> Classify the following sources as either biological, 
> systematic, or random error.  
> 1). A scale is broken and provides inconsistent readings.  
> 2). A scale is calibrated wrongly and consistently measures mice 1 gram heavier.   
> 3). A mouse has an unusually high weight compared to its experimental group (i.e., it is an outlier).  
> 4). Strong atmospheric low pressure and accompanying storms affect instrument readings, animal behavior, and indoor relative humidity.

## True replication

## Balanced incomplete block designs





Experimental units can be grouped, or *blocked*, to increase the precision of
treatment comparisons. Imagine that you want to evaluate the effect of different 
doses of a new drug on the proliferation of cancer cells in vitro. Divide the 
cells into four groups, each consisting of the same number of cells. Treat each 
group with a different dose of the drug for five consecutive days. For example, 
the four treatments could be:

Group 1: Control (no drug)
Group 2: Low dose (10 μM)
Group 3: Medium dose (50 μM)
Group 4: High dose (100 μM)

# create dosage levels
f <- factor(c("control", "low", "medium", "high"))
b1t <- sample(f, 4)
b2t <- sample(f, 4)
b3t <- sample(f, 4)
b4t <- sample(f, 4)
t <- c(b1t, b2t, b3t, b4t)
block <- factor(rep(c("shelf1", "shelf2", "shelf3", "shelf4"), each = 4))
cagenum <- rep(1:4, 4)
plan <- data.frame(block = block, CageNumber = cagenum, treatment = t)
