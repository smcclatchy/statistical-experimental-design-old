title: "Completely Randomized Designs"
teaching: 0
exercises: 0
questions:
- "What is a completely randomized design (CRD)?"
objectives:
- "CRD is the simplest experimental design."
- "In CRD, treatments are assigned randomly to experimental units."
- "CRD assumes that the experimental units are relatively homogeneous or similar."
- "CRD doesn't remove or account for systematic differences among experimental units."
keypoints:
- "CRD is a simple design that can be used when experimental are homogeneous."

## A single qualitative factor

## Analysis of variance (ANOVA)

> ## Exercise 1: Which kind of error?
> A study used to determine the effect of a drug on weight loss 
> could have the following sources of experimental error. 
> Classify the following sources as either biological, 
> systematic, or random error.  
> 1). A scale is broken and provides inconsistent readings.  
> 2). A scale is calibrated wrongly and consistently measures mice 1 gram heavier.   
> 3). A mouse has an unusually high weight compared to its experimental group (i.e., it is an outlier).  
> 4). Strong atmospheric low pressure and accompanying storms affect instrument readings, animal behavior, and indoor relative humidity.
