## The first step in data analysis: plot the data!
A picture is worth a thousand words, and a picture of your data could reveal
important information that can guide you forward. So firxst, plot the data!


~~~
# simulate Generation 100 resting heart rate data for the 1,567 study 
# participants
# rnorm() generates a random normal distribution from the mean and standard
# deviation values you provide
simulated_heart_rates <- rnorm(n = 1567, mean = 80, sd = 10)
hist(simulated_heart_rates, xlab = "resting heart rate")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="../fig/rmd-03-simulate_gen100_data-1.png" alt="plot of chunk simulate_gen100_data" width="612" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk simulate_gen100_data</p>
</div>

Now create a boxplot of the same data.


~~~
boxplot(simulated_heart_rates)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="../fig/rmd-03-boxplot_simulated_gen100_data-1.png" alt="plot of chunk boxplot_simulated_gen100_data" width="612" />
<p class="caption">plot of chunk boxplot_simulated_gen100_data</p>
</div>

> ## Exercise 2: What does this boxplot tell you about resting heart rates?  
> What does the box signify?  
> What does horizontal black line dividing the box signify?  
> Are there apparent outliers?  
> How does the boxplot relate to the histogram?
> What message do the data deliver in this boxplot?

## Plotting
Plotting the data can reveal relationships between variables, identify unusual 
response measurements (**outliers**) and guide further statistical analysis.
When data are not normally distributed (bell-shaped and symmetrical), many of 
the statistical methods typically used will not perform well. In these cases
the data can be transformed to a more symmetrical bell-shaped curve.

## Statistical significance testing
The Generation 100 studied aims to determine whether high-intensity exercise in
elderly adults affects lifespan and healthspan. High cardiorespiratory fitness,
the supply of oxygen to skeletal muscles, is linked to high blood volume in the 
elderly. It is well known that physical activity can increase blood volume and
that high blood volume is crucial to athletic performance, however, this is the
first study to demonstrate this relationship in elderly people.

To test whether exercise affects blood volume, a substudy of 50 volunteers from
the Generation 100 study were [placed in two groups](https://frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2021.638139/full) 
- fit or unfit - depending on results of peak oxygen uptake testing. Exercise
was objectively measured with a wearable sensor for one week between peak 
oxygen testing and blood volume measurements.
