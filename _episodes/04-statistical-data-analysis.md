## The first step in data analysis: plot the data!
A picture is worth a thousand words, and a picture of your data could reveal
important information that can guide you forward. So first, plot the data!


~~~
# simulate Generation 100 resting heart rate data for the 1,567 study 
# participants
# rnorm() generates a random normal distribution from the mean and standard
# deviation values you provide
simulated_heart_rates <- rnorm(n = 1567, mean = 80, sd = 10)
hist(simulated_heart_rates, xlab = "resting heart rate")
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-simulate_gen100_data-1.png" alt="plot of chunk simulate_gen100_data" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
## A picture is worth a thousand words

> ## Exercise 1: What does this picture tell you about resting heart rates?  
> Are there gaps in the data?  
> Are there large clusters of similar heart rate values in the data?  
> Are there apparent outliers?  
> Do the left and right tails of the data seem to mirror each other or not?

Now create a boxplot of the same data.


~~~
boxplot(simulated_heart_rates)
~~~
{: .language-r}

<img src="../fig/rmd-03-boxplot_simulated_gen100_data-1.png" alt="plot of chunk boxplot_simulated_gen100_data" width="612" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

> ## Exercise 2: What does this boxplot tell you about resting heart rates?  
> What does the box signify?  
> What does horizontal black line dividing the box signify?  
> Are there apparent outliers?  
> How does the boxplot relate to the histogram?
