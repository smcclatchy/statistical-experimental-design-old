Variability is natural in the real world. A medication given to a group of 
patients will affect each of them differently. A specific diet given to a cage
of mice will affect each mouse differently. Ideally if something is measured 
many times, each measurement will give exactly the same result and will 
represent the true value. This ideal doesn't exist in the real world. For 
example, the mass of one kilogram is defined by the International Prototype 
Kilogram, a cylinder composed of platinum and iridium. Copies of this prototype kilogram (replicates) are distributed worldwide and are regularly compared to 
the original to ensure the standard mass of one kilogram. None of the copies of 
the prototype measure precisely the same despite careful storage and handling. 
The reasons for this variation in measurements is not known.

## the experiment

> ## Exercise 1: Which kind of error?
> A study used to determine the effect of a drug on weight loss 
> could have the following sources of experimental error. 
> Classify the following sources as either biological, 
> systematic, or random error.  
> 1). A scale is broken and provides inconsistent readings.  
> 2). A scale is calibrated wrongly and consistently measures mice 1 gram heavier.   
> 3). A mouse has an unusually high weight compared to its experimental group (i.e., it is an outlier).  
> 4). Strong atmospheric low pressure and accompanying storms affect instrument readings, animal behavior, and indoor relative humidity.
